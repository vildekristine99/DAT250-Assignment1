# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 3

## Installation: MongoDB Database
I didn't really have any problems with the installation other than it was a bit difficult to navigate the site that was linked. 
When I was trying to get the correct validation of the installation package I had some problems. I had named the file with the copied text from the website different from what the tutorial said.
Here is a screenshot of valid innstalation:

The functions I made help us se how many oranges in total everyone bought. It could also be extended in a way so all oranges in total was calculated to get the monthley or weekly amout off oranges sold.
