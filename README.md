# DAT250-Assignment1

The download itself tok a small amount of time. I had the JDK, Eclipse and Git client already. I am a little unsure if I managed to install Maven correctly.

Creating a profile on Heroku also went well, but I needed to register a credit card to be verified. I decided to not register so the addons section in the tutorial did not work.

The tutorial on Heroku was nice and detailed and it went well until "mvn clean install" under "Push local changes"-section. It did not work so I had to use "mvnw clean install". I think it either was because I have Java 12 and the app was Java 8, or I actually did not do the Maven installation correctly. There was also a problem with the "mvw" command, but it was just a PATH that was not written correctly.

Furthermore, addons as mentioned earlier, did not work. I also had to install postgres for the database section, but it went well.

Here is the link to the app :)
