# Experiment 6

I had no problems this time. Both tutorials worked fine!

In the react tutorial i chose to make the application on my own computer.

The code only contains the src directory since the app was to large to upload to git.

Here is the link to my repository: https://github.com/vildekristine99/Experiment6
