## Oppgave 1
I didnt understand that the JSON was ment to be in body -> raw, but other than that it worked fine.

## Oppgave 2
I had some trouble understanding what we were supposed to do with the todo-class and what in the counter example was spark. 
I didn't do it with a database, and there I had som problems with id and the generation of that. I made a solution, but when deleted the id doesn't become available.
