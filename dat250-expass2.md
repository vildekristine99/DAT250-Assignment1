# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2
## Experiment 1
### Step 4.3 - 5
It was extremely difficult to follow the tutorial given. The steps was difficult to follow and I didn't realy understand which source code we were expected to use. Much of the confusion came from the fact that we were first given a code, but later in the tutorial you are asked to create a new java project. I then found out we actually needed to create a maven project and / or use the project we took from git as a starting point again.

When I tried to get lombok to work i had some problems. I though I had downloaded it correctly and imported the neccessary jar to the project. The notation worked, but getter, setter, toString() etc. did not generate. So in main i could not access getters and setters.

To look into the database i used ij in the command line (https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheDerby/article.html)

### Step 6
Here we were going to make a new java project, but I just got errors on the tests. Insted I copied the jpp-basic project that was released, and used it as a starting point.

## Experiment 2
I had som difficulties understanding what was expected in the assignment, but once i understood a project like in step 6 it went better. I am not sure i got the database completely right. I tried to use lombok as mentioned in Experiment 1 but had the same difficulties. I ended up with these tables:

I think my main mathod where I added to the tables must hav been done worng. This is how the creditcard table looked like

## Summary
I dont feel like the assignment should have taken as much time as it did, but every step on the way a new small problem or a step with little to no information slow down the progress. Very confusing and not a all fitting tutorial.
